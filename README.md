The Decentralized Fund Disbursal System Using IPFS is a secure, transparent, and trustless platform built to automate the distribution of funds using blockchain technology. This system ensures that funds are disbursed only when pre-defined conditions are met, removing the need for intermediaries or centralized control.

The application is built with React for the frontend, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface, and smart contracts on the blockchain to handle the logic of fund disbursal.

IPFS is used to store essential supporting documents (e.g., proof of eligibility, reports, receipts) in a decentralized manner. This ensures that all data remains tamper-proof, accessible, and censorship-resistant.
